The above script basically composes my email address in the browser so that it doesn't get scraped
Here is a newlined version (the with tag doesn't allow for new lines i think)
        '<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
        var part1 = "door2door";
        var part2 = Math.pow(2,6);
        var part3 = String.fromCharCode(part2);
        var part4 = "ratchek.com";
        var part5 = part1 + String.fromCharCode(part2) + part4;
        document.write("<a href=" + "mai" + "lto" + ":"
        + part5 + ">" + part1 + part3 + part4 + "</a>.");
        </script>'

            <summary> Why do some addresses not have owner info?</summary>
            <p> This tool is used only for residential properties.
                Furthermore, NYC does not require landlords to register if the property has 1-2 residential units
                and the owner or their immediate family lives there.
                In either of those cases, the owner will not show up in the database.</p>
