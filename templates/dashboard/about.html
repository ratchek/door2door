        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> This is a simple tool aimed at making the life of real-estate agents a bit easier. It aids with direct, door-to-door selling and marketing. </p>
        <p> There are two main components to this app:<p>
            <ol>
                <li> A system that allows you to keep track of the places you've visited, in which places you've managed to speak to the owner, along with any notes you might have for each address. </li>
                <li> A search functionality that allows you to look up the owner of a particular building (this only works for residential buildings located in NYC, where the owner has registered with the HPD) </li>
            </ol>
            <p> This is mostly a hobbyist project, so I make no guarantees. <strong> Before you start using the app, please read the disclaimers below.</strong> </p>
